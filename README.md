# EE230C - Fall 2024
Repo housing code for the final project of the EE230C class at UCB (Fall 2024). 
Group: Elizabeth Juette, Vir Karan, Wayne Zhao

There are two solutions to the tight-binding Hamiltonian for monolayer MoS2 implemented in this repo:
1. following the work of [1] and [2] (housed in TB11.py), which uses the d5 orbitals of Mo and the p3 oribitals of S as the basis set.
2. a more general TB approach following [3] (housed in TB27.py), which uses the sp3d5 orbitals from Mo and S, totally 27 states in the basis set.
The submitted report for the final is also uploaded here as project_submission.pdf.
